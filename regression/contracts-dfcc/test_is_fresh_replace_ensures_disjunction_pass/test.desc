Illustrates the behaviour of `__CPROVER_is_fresh` under disjunctions in assume contexts.
The postcondition of `foo` describes a disjunction of cases: either `x` is fresh and `y` is null,
or `x` is null and `y` is fresh. The function `bar` branches on `y == NULL`.
The test succeeds if the two `assert(0)` are falsifiable, which which shows that
both cases of the disjunction expressed in the ensures clause of `foo` are reachable.

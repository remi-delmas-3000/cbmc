Marked as KNWONBUG because:
- z3 >v4.12 and up can solve the problem with `--dfcc-simple-invalid-pointer-model`,
 but the CI uses older versions;
- bitwuzla >v0.6 can solve the problem but we don't run bitwuzla in CI.

Tests support for quantifiers in loop contracts with the SMT backend.
When quantified loop invariants are used, they are inserted three times
in the transformed program (base case assertion, step case assumption,
step case assertion), and each occurrence needs to be rewritten with fresh
symbols for the quantified variables. The SMT solver would with an error
whenever this renaming is not properly done.

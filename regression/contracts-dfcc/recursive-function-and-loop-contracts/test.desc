This test illustrates the analysis of a function with a combination of features:
- the function is recursive
- the function contains loops
- the function assigns local static variables

The following write set checks are performed:
- the write set of the recursive call is included in the caller'set
- the write set of each loop is included in the outer write set, either the
  function's write set or some loop's write set)
- local statics are automatically detected and added to each write set
- the instructions are checked against their respective write sets

Checks whether contract enforcement works with (local and global) static variables.
Local static variables should be part of the local write set.
Shows that we detect using the source location  even when there is space 
before the declaration and the actual start of the program.
Global static variables should be included in the global write set,
otherwise any assignment to it is invalid.
